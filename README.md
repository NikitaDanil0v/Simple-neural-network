### Simple neural network

Single layer feedforward neural network (perceptron). We use binary digits as our inputs and expect binary digits as our outputs. We'll use [backpropagation](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) via gradient descent to train our network and make our prediction as accurate as possible.

### Dependencies

None! Just numpy.

### Usage

Run ``python main.py`` in terminal to see it train, then predict.
